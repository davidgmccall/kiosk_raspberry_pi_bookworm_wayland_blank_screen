# kiosk_raspberry_pi_bookworm_wayland_blank_screen
Blank the screen on a raspberry pi running bookworm / wayland
while running chromium-browser in kiosk mode.

I tried finding something that would work with wayland on my raspberry pi but was not able to find anything.

Plenty of solutions for X11.

## Depends on:

  - keyd  (https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd.git)
  
  - pqiv  (sudo apt install pqiv)
